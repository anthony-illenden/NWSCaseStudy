This is a GitHub repository of Python scripts used for a lake enhancement case study for a summer project at the NWS Detroit. The scripts were written in Juptyer notebooks using Visual Studio Code. All the model data comes from UCAR's Thredds Catalog, so you do not have to download any model data. The only data you need to download is the .csv file containing the local storm reports. This .csv file came from the Iowa State IEM website. To view the case study click the following link: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c05303b570f24e4790caf878986dc52b
